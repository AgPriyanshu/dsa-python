# A thief needs to rob money in a street. The houses in the street are arranged in a circular manner.
# Therefore the first and the last house are adjacent to each other. The security system in the street is
# such that if adjacent houses are robbed, the police will get notified.

# Given an array of integers â€œArr'' which represents money at each house, we need to return the maximum
# amount of money that the thief can rob without alerting the police.
